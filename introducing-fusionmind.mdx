We are thrilled to announce FusionMind's Research Preview, an AI-powered research assistant aiming to revolutionize the way researchers approach complex problems by leveraging multidisciplinary thinking across various fields of science.

## Bridging Scientific Disciplines

FusionMind's core strength lies in its ability to associate problems with solutions found in literature from seemingly unrelated fields of study. By harnessing the power of AI, machine learning, and graph-based knowledge representation, FusionMind can identify novel connections and insights that might otherwise remain undiscovered.

## How Does It Work?

1. Start by writing a research question in your field of study.
2. Then, select an adjacent or unexpected "target" field of study to draw inspiration from.

â–¶ FusionMind's advanced AI explores the intersections, surfacing relevant concepts and scholarly papers that bridge disciplines!

## Current Capabilities and Limitations

As we are in the research preview stage, FusionMind's capabilities are currently limited. You may find that some solutions don't always make sense, or that some articles pop up more than others.
This is entirely normal, as our model is still in its early stages.

## Join Us on This Adventure

We are looking forward to refining and expanding FusionMind's capabilities with the help of the research community. Your feedback and insights will be invaluable as we continue to develop this tool.
